3. See [API Reference](../API_REFERENCE.md) *(Planned)* for code integration

## Game Overview

Castle Knights is a hex-based tactical combat game featuring:

- **Deep Tactical Combat**: Positioning, facing, and terrain matter
- **Morale System**: Units can break and route under pressure
- **Line of Sight**: Terrain blocks vision and ranged attacks
- **General Abilities**: Command powers that turn the tide of battle
- **Multiple Unit Types**: Each with unique strengths and capabilities

## System Requirements

The game systems documented here include:

### Core Components
- **Units**: Individual combat entities with stats, behaviors, and AI
- **Terrain**: Hexagonal battlefields with varied terrain effects
- **Combat**: Detailed damage calculations with multiple attack modes
- **Visibility**: Fog of war with line-of-sight calculations
- **AI**: Intelligent computer opponents

### Advanced Features
- **Animation System**: Smooth visual feedback for all actions
- **Save/Load**: Persistent game state management
- **Test Scenarios**: Pre-configured battles for testing features
- **Scenario Editor**: JSON-based scenario creation tools

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Follow the structure**: Use clear headings and code examples
2. **Cross-reference**: Link related systems and mechanics
3. **Include examples**: Show both code snippets and gameplay scenarios
4. **Update this index**: Add new documents to the appropriate sections

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown format for all documentation
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Provide both technical implementation details and strategic implications
- Reference specific file locations for code elements
- Include visual diagrams where helpful (ASCII art is acceptable)

## Game Balance Philosophy

The systems documented here reflect a design philosophy emphasizing:

- **Realistic Tactics**: Historical military principles apply
- **Meaningful Choices**: Every decision has strategic consequences  
- **Dynamic Battles**: Situations can change rapidly based on morale and positioning
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Complex interactions arise from simple rules
- **Accessibility**: Deep mechanics that are learnable and intuitive

## Version History

- **v1.0** (Current) - Initial documentation covering routing system
- **v0.9** - Archer line-of-sight feature documentation
- **v0.8** - Core game implementation
