I think when archer shooting and not involving in one to one combat it's not engaged. [FIXED]
I think we need to check if we clear engaged status correctly as I've seen unit with status engaged but nobody around. [FIXED - Ghost Engagement]
I am not sure about current battle resolution logic between units. I mean when there is a huge difference in power the unit should be destroyed
On fight both units should receive damage [FIXED - Archers in melee now take damage]
soldier loose cannot be fractional [FIXED]
I think we should include unit quality enum, as superior units maybe can go to battle twice after routing or even 3 times, but maybe others should never recover from routing [FIXED - Implemented UnitQuality]
