I think when archer shooting and not involving in one to one combat it's not engaged.
I think we need to check if we clear engaged status correctly as I've seen unit with status engaged but nobody around. 
I am not sure about current battle resolution logic between units. I mean when there is a huge difference in power the unit should be destroyed
On fight both units should receive damage 
soldier loose cannot be fractional 
I think we should include unit quality enum, as superior units maybe can go to battle twice after routing or even 3 times, but maybe others should never recover from routing
