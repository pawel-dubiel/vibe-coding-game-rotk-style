1 done I want to see in info panel what generals are attached to a unit
2 done I want to ensure that frontage is in use so we not calculating strength during combat just from unit soldiers but we take frontage into account
3 Maybe we should try to simulate a single battle between units, in rounds we need some good algorithm used from real war simulators, but still simple
4 done When I click enemy unit i want to see info about enemy unit
5 players should be able to attack enemy castle and force enemy to surrender
6 Will be nice to have a unit type like ram for taking the gate in the castle
7 Cavarly shouldn't be able to attack castle
8 We should have a status like distrupted and for example if unit is disrupted it get severe penalty in combat
9 Cavarly is automatically distrupted when it is in the forest, or when it is in the castle or in the hill
10 When animating movement i would like to see an arrow between each field to show choosen path
11 Fog of war
12 Cavarly cannot charge towards hills ( when enemy is on the hill ) and cannot charge when is on the hill itself
13 When archer is on the hill, and enemy archer attacks not from the hill (is lower), the attack should be less effective
