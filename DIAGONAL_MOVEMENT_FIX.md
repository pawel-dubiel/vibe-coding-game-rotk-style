# Diagonal Movement Fix Documentation

## Problem
Units could only move and attack in 4 orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) but not diagonally, which is unrealistic for a grid-based strategy game.

## Solution
Updated all movement and combat systems to support 8-directional movement and attacks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Movement System (`/game/behaviors/movement.py`)
- Changed direction checks from 4 to 8 directions:
  ```python
  # Old: [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
  # New: [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
  ```
- Updated all adjacent checks to include diagonals
- Fixed Zone of Control to work with diagonal adjacency

### 2. Combat System (`/game/behaviors/combat.py`)
- Changed from Manhattan distance to Chebyshev distance:
  ```python
  # Old: distance = abs(unit.x - target.x) + abs(unit.y - target.y)
  # New: distance = max(abs(unit.x - target.x), abs(unit.y - target.y))
  ```
- This allows diagonal attacks at the same range as orthogonal

### 3. Special Abilities (`/game/behaviors/special_abilities.py`)
- Updated cavalry charge to work diagonally
- Fixed charge target detection for all 8 directions

### 4. Visual Updates (`/game/renderer.py`)
- Zone of Control indicators now show for all 8 adjacent squares

## Game Impact

### Movement
- Units can now move diagonally, making movement more natural
- A unit with 3 movement can reach more squares efficiently
- Diagonal movement costs the same as orthogonal (1 movement point)

### Combat
- Melee units can attack diagonally adjacent enemies
- Archers can shoot diagonally at their full range
- Zone of Control affects all 8 adjacent squares

### Tactics
- Flanking is now possible from 8 directions instead of 4
- Units can escape more easily by moving diagonally
- Formations are more flexible with diagonal support
- Cavalry charges work from diagonal positions

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite created in `/tests/test_diagonal_movement.py` covering:
- Basic diagonal movement
- Diagonal attacks (melee and ranged)
- Zone of Control in all directions
- Cavalry charges diagonally
- Movement blocking by enemies
- Formation mechanics with diagonal positions

All tests passing successfully!

## Example Scenarios

### Before (4 directions):
```
. . E . .
. . . . .
E . U . E
. . . . .
. . E . .
```
Unit U could only attack/move to 4 enemies.

### After (8 directions):
```
E . E . E
. . . . .
E . U . E
. . . . .
E . E . E
```
Unit U can now attack/move to all 8 adjacent enemies!

This makes the game more tactical and realistic while maintaining balance.
