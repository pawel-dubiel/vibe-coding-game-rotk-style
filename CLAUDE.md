- test everything
- tests should be isolated
- write end-to-end tests for critical paths
- use fixtures for setup
- use factories for data generation
- after every feature, write tests and run all existing tests
- run tests: `source .venv/bin/activate && SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy pytest`
- architecture (high level):
  - battle uses command/event flow with domain rules separated from presentation
  - headless client/server direction with adapters at the boundary
  - campaign rules are a separate domain
